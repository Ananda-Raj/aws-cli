# ami_checker_delete.sh

Script to Check AMI and delete unused

Conditions that are checked by the Script: Check if the AMI has a tag - DeletionProtection value Yes Check if the AMI is used by any current instance. Check if the AMI is in any AutoScaling Group. Check if the AMI is in any Launch Template (last 2 versions). Check if the AMI is in any Launch Configuration. Check if the AMI is in Elastic Beanstalk environments. Check if the AMI is in Spot Instance requests

Working: From one account, it will take the list if all AMI and check for any one of the 7 condition above. If any is found, it will be ignored. If not, then we will be asked for a prompt if we need to delete that AMI. Choosing Y/y will delete that AMI and associated snapshots. Manual exclusion of AMI for different clients in the environments: This requires the AMI to have a tag - DeletionProtection value Yes . All AMI with this tag is ignored and wonâ€™t be deleted.

Execution: This script can be executed with AWS CLI RW privilege for any users on our bastion. They will need to have a .aws/config file with all the required clients. A sample of execution for Phobs-Dev account is attached. We can add this as cron for clients to run every month or can manually run during an audit to clean up the AMIs.

It will give an output like below incase the AMI is detected in Spot request:
```
Taking AMI ami-06ae23b3c92c1db60
This AMI is currently in use for Instance.

IN USE - This AMI ami-06ae23b3c92c1db60 is currently in use, so not deleting.
